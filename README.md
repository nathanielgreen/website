# Personal Website

This is the code for my personal website: http://ngreen.co.
It's main purpose is to act as a portfolio for particular projects I have worked
on and some that I may still be buiding. 

Projects that are listed on the portfolio
will usually have a link to a live version of the project, and that projects
code on Github.

It also provides some information about who I am, as well as links to my 
social media, and other info such as my Email, CV, and Blog, 


# Technologies Used

The site uses only basic HTML & CSS to keep the load times quick and also not
overcomplicate the design of the portfolio.
